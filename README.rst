1. **Calibrate the system**
    a) Sync Myo with +x axis pointing towards elbow
    b) Align the system by making a Fist pose.
       This sets the base position used as a reference for yaw, pitch, roll rotations
       An ideal base position would be Myo arm kept straight and parallel to the ground

3. **Pitch arm up/down to move drone up/down**

4. **Roll arm left/right to turn drone left/right**
